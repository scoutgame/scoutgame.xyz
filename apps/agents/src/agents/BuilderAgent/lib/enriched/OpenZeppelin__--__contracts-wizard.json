  "summary": "The OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard is a web application aimed at simplifying the creation of smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain and StarkNet, supporting both Solidity and Cairo programming languages. It offers an interactive interface that enables users to select and customize contract types, such as ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155, by setting parameters and choosing features like access control, upgradeability, and pausability. The application generates ready-to-compile and deploy code, which can also be further customized with specific application logic. Built on OpenZeppelin's secure and audited contract libraries, it ensures the reliability and security of the generated smart contracts. Additionally, the wizard provides options for embedding on other websites and a programmatic API for integration into custom applications, enhancing its versatility for developers.",
