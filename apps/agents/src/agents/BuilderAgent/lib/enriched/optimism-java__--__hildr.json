  "summary": "Hildr is an OP Stack rollup client developed in Java 21 with GraalVM native support, specifically designed to enhance the Optimism ecosystem's scalability and efficiency. It serves as a Java-based alternative to existing Rust and Go implementations, adhering to the specifications for rollup nodes in the Ethereum-optimism repository. Hildr facilitates the operation and synchronization of Optimism's Layer 2 solutions by interacting with both Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) networks, supporting various synchronization modes such as full sync and checkpoint sync. It is tailored for the Optimism Sepolia testnet and requires specific system resources, including Java 21 and Go 1.20.8. The project emphasizes ease of deployment through Docker, making it accessible for developers to run their nodes. Hildr's functionality includes running a rollup node, interacting with Ethereum's execution engine, and supporting the Optimism network's goals of scalability and efficiency. As an open-source project, Hildr encourages community contributions, fostering a collaborative environment for further development and innovation in blockchain technology.",
