  "summary": "Zebra is a full-node implementation for the Zcash network, crafted in Rust to ensure secure and efficient interaction with the Zcash blockchain. It is designed to achieve consensus with the Zcash network and seamlessly interoperate with `zcashd`. While Zebra validates blocks and transactions, it relies on additional software for their generation. The implementation supports transaction generation through `lightwalletd` and block generation via mining software or pools. Emphasizing security, Zebra adheres to a responsible disclosure policy and is licensed under both MIT and Apache-2.0, with certain components exclusively under MIT due to their origins. The project is maintained by the Zcash Foundation, which provides extensive documentation and user support, aiming to offer a robust platform for engaging with the Zcash blockchain.",
