  "summary": "The Yearn Protocol Documentation Website is a comprehensive guide designed for users and developers engaging with the Yearn Finance ecosystem. Utilizing Docusaurus, it offers extensive documentation on Yearn's offerings, such as yVaults, yLockers, and yPools, along with resources for developers aiming to build on Yearn. The site distinguishes itself by providing both general documentation and Natspec documentation derived from smart contracts, which includes details on contract versions, functionalities, and integration guides. It facilitates local development, enabling contributors to set up their environment, implement changes, and observe updates in real-time. Additionally, the website supports RPC calls to fetch and display on-chain contract data directly within the documentation. Structured to accommodate a diverse audience, including end-users, developers, and Yearn DAO contributors, the documentation is an essential tool for navigating and contributing to the Yearn ecosystem. Its design emphasizes ease of updates and maintenance, ensuring that information remains clear and accessible for understanding Yearn's products and services, as well as for contributing to the protocol.",
