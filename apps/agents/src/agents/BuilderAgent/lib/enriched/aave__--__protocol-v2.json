It also facilitates collateral management and flash loans, offering users flexible borrowing options. The codebase is designed for modularity, security, and scalability, ensuring a robust foundation for the Aave Protocol's functionalities. Additionally, it includes adapters for seamless integration with external protocols like Uniswap and ParaSwap, enhancing liquidity and user experience.
