  "summary": "Cairo is a Turing-complete programming language and compiler designed for creating provable programs for general computation, with an emphasis on efficiency and speed. The compiler, written in Rust, supports the compilation and execution of Cairo files, including the compilation of Starknet contracts. Cairo is tailored for developing smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on the Starknet platform, offering features such as provable computation and efficient contract compilation. The project is committed to achieving feature parity with previous versions of Cairo and actively encourages community contributions to enhance its capabilities. With a focus on high performance and robust development tools, Cairo aims to be a foundational technology for developers working on complex computational tasks and smart contract development.",
