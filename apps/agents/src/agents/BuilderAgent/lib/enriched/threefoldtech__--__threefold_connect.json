  "summary": "ThreeFold Connect is a mobile application designed as the main interface for the ThreeFold Grid and its services, focusing on user security and control. It incorporates a secure two-factor authentication (2FA) system for third-party applications, allowing users to manage their ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) and view transaction histories within the app. The application also provides tools for managing ThreeFold nodes, known as 'farmers', and includes a news section for the latest updates, a support chat feature for assistance, and an identity verification section for secure data sharing with third-party apps. Emphasizing privacy and data ownership, ThreeFold Connect offers users granular control over the personal information they share, supporting a seamless and secure interaction with decentralized services. Built on a modern codebase, it facilitates local development and integrates various functionalities such as news, wallet management, farmer management, and support into a cohesive user experience.",
