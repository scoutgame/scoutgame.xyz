  "summary": "The Identus TypeScript SDK is a comprehensive toolkit designed for developers to build applications leveraging self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles. It facilitates the creation, management, and resolution of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, enabling secure and private identity management. Built on Cardano, it supports DIDComm V2 for secure messaging and offers a modular architecture with components like Apollo for cryptographic operations, Castor for DID management, Pollux for handling verifiable credentials, Mercury for DIDComm messages, and Pluto for storage operations. The SDK is designed to be platform-agnostic, with support for browser and Node.js environments, and includes demo applications to help developers get started. It aims to simplify the integration of SSI into applications, making it easier to adopt decentralized identity solutions. Additionally, it provides a suite of cryptographic operations, DID management, credential handling, and secure messaging through DIDComm V2, supporting multiple platforms with versions available for TypeScript, Swift, and Kotlin Multi-Platform. This versatility makes it suitable for various development environments, offering tools for issuing DIDs, managing verifiable credentials, and facilitating secure communications between entities in a decentralized ecosystem.",
