  "summary": "The Gaia x RAG API Pipeline is a Python-based tool designed to create a vector knowledge base from any REST API data source. It utilizes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide contextual responses to user queries by integrating with a Gaia node's LLM model. The pipeline processes data through several stages: extracting data from REST APIs, normalizing and chunking the data, generating embeddings, and storing the processed data in a Qdrant vector database. This enables efficient querying and retrieval of information. The tool is highly configurable, allowing users to define their own API pipeline manifests and customize the data processing workflow according to their specific needs. It also includes a CLI for easy setup and execution, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise. Designed with flexibility in mind, it supports a comprehensive workflow from data extraction to embedding generation, catering to applications that require efficient data processing and utilization.",
