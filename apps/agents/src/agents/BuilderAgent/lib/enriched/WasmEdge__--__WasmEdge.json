  "summary": "WasmEdge is a high-performance, lightweight, and extensible WebAssembly runtime designed for a broad spectrum of applications, including modern web application architectures, edge cloud microservices, serverless SaaS APIs, embedded functions, and smart devices. Recognized as the fastest WebAssembly Virtual Machine (VM) and an official sandbox project hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), WasmEdge provides a secure execution sandbox for WebAssembly bytecode programs. This ensures isolation and protection for operating system resources and memory space. A key use case of WasmEdge is the safe execution of user-defined or community-contributed code as plugins in software products, allowing third-party developers and community members to extend and customize software products. It supports running standard WebAssembly bytecode programs compiled from various programming languages and includes features like running JavaScript in a secure sandbox, supporting server-side rendering (SSR) functions on edge servers, and integrating with cloud-native and edge computing extensions. Additionally, WasmEdge offers extensions tailored for cloud-native and edge computing uses, such as network sockets, database drivers for Postgres and MySQL, and AI inference capabilities, further broadening its application scope.",
