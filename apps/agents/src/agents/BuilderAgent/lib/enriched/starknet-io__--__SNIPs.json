  "summary": "The SNIPs repository is focused on the Starknet Improvement Proposal process, drawing inspiration from Ethereum's EIP process. It serves as a platform for documenting standardized protocols for Starknet-related software, ensuring that these documents are of high quality and implementable. The repository enables contributors to propose changes to the Starknet ecosystem, including new features, improvements, and standards. It facilitates a structured process for the submission of draft SNIPs, community discussion, review by SNIP editors, and the progression of SNIPs through various stages (Draft, Review, Last Call, Final) based on community consensus and technical soundness. This structured approach supports the Starknet community by ensuring that enhancements are well-documented, reviewed, and agreed upon, thereby maintaining the ecosystem's integrity and fostering innovation and compatibility among Starknet applications and services.",
