  "summary": "This GitHub repository hosts the code for an enhanced version of the Aave protocol's AToken, specifically designed for the Aave V3 protocol. The ATokenWithDelegation contract introduces delegation features, enabling token holders to delegate their voting and proposition powers to other addresses without transferring the tokens themselves. This functionality is crucial for governance, allowing users to participate in the Aave governance system more flexibly. The repository encompasses a comprehensive suite of smart contracts, tests, and specifications aimed at ensuring the security and functionality of the delegation mechanism. Written in Solidity, the code integrates with Aave V3 core contracts and is structured to be highly modular, facilitating easier audits and extensions. Additionally, the repository includes a Makefile for building and testing the contracts, highlighting a commitment to developer experience and code quality. Detailed documentation and specifications are provided to aid developers and users in understanding and effectively utilizing the delegation features, underscoring the project's emphasis on formal verification and security, which are paramount in DeFi applications.",
