  "summary": "This GitHub repository hosts the code for a decentralized prediction market platform that utilizes Uniswap V3's Automated Market Maker (AMM) to facilitate liquidity provision and the trading of outcome tokens. The platform enables users to create markets on a wide range of outcomes, stake on these outcomes, and trade tokens that represent different market outcomes. It integrates with the UMA protocol's Optimistic Oracle for the decentralized and trustless resolution of market outcomes, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the process. Designed with modularity in mind, the platform allows for straightforward upgrades and integration with other DeFi protocols. Core functionalities include the creation of markets, trading of outcome tokens, provision of liquidity, and resolution of markets, all of which are managed through smart contracts to guarantee transparency and security.",
