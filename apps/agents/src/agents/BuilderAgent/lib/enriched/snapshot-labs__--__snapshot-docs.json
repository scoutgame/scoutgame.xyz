  "summary": "Snapshot is a decentralized voting platform tailored for DAOs, DeFi protocols, and NFT communities, facilitating gasless and customizable voting processes. It supports a variety of voting mechanisms such as single choice, approval voting, and quadratic voting, offering flexibility in calculating voting power and validating proposals and votes. Operating off-chain, Snapshot ensures that voting results are easily verifiable and difficult to contest. The platform is built around three core components: spaces (organization profiles), proposals (suggestions for change), and votes. Each space requires an ENS domain for setup, allowing administrators to customize the rules for creating proposals and voting by configuring various voting and validation strategies. Key features include gasless voting, flexible voting strategies, multiple voting systems, signed messages for vote verification, custom branding for spaces, and being fully open-source. Snapshot's protocol is highly customizable, catering to the diverse needs of its users and organizations, making it a versatile tool for decentralized governance.",
