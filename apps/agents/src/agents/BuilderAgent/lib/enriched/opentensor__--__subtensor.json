  "summary": "Subtensor is a foundational technology within the Bittensor ecosystem, designed to support decentralized machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks. It operates as a substrate-chain, facilitating a distributed network of nodes that manage consensus mechanisms and enable value transfer through its native cryptocurrency, TAO. Subtensor is tailored for developers and researchers, offering tools for subnet development, testing, and the creation of incentive mechanisms. It supports various system architectures, including Linux and MacOS, and requires specific network configurations for operation. The project emphasizes extensibility and customization, providing comprehensive documentation for node setup, contribution, and platform development. Subtensor's architecture is engineered to support a wide range of blockchain functionalities, making it a pivotal component for decentralized AI and machine learning services within the Bittensor network.",
