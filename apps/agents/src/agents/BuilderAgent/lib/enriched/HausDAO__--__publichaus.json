  "summary": "The PublicHAUS Onboarder and Publichaus repository are front-end applications designed to enhance user interaction with the PublicHAUS DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization focused on community governance and participation. These applications allow users to stake HAUS tokens in exchange for community loot, enabling participation in governance decisions and seasonal reward sessions. Key features include viewing DAO operators (champions), claiming rewards, applying to become a champion, and accessing the DAO's manifesto. The applications integrate with smart contracts to manage staking, rewards, and governance proposals, facilitating a transparent and community-driven decision-making process. Designed to be redeployed and configured for each new season, they ensure alignment with the DAO's evolving governance structures, empowering communities to coordinate and govern themselves effectively.",
