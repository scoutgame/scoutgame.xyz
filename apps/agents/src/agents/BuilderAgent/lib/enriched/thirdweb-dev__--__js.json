  "summary": "The thirdweb TypeScript SDK is a comprehensive development toolkit aimed at simplifying the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) across various platforms, including browsers, Node.js, and mobile apps. It supports React and React-Native, offering features like embedded wallets for social/email login, account abstraction, and instant connection to any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain through RPC Edge integration. The SDK also includes IPFS upload/download capabilities, UI components for connection and transactions, and high-level contract extensions for interacting with common standards. With automatic ABI resolution, it facilitates easier interaction with smart contracts. Designed as an all-in-one solution, it compares favorably with other libraries such as Wagmi + Viem and Ethers@6, showcasing its unique features and advantages. The repository welcomes contributions from developers of all experience levels and provides extensive documentation, templates, and additional resources to support project development.",
