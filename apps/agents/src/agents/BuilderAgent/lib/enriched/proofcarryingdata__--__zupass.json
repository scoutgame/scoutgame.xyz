  "summary": "Zupass is a software platform designed for managing and storing Proof-Carrying Data (PCD), which includes any data whose validity and well-formedness can be cryptographically verified. It supports a variety of data types such as signatures, Merkle proofs, zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, hash commitments, and keypairs. The platform allows users to organize their PCDs and respond to queries from third-party applications, enabling secure and private interactions. Applications of Zupass range from gated access to digital communities, anonymous voting, game leaderboards, social media data portability, to financial service verifications. Zupass is built with a developer-friendly SDK that facilitates the creation and verification of PCDs, including support for zkSNARKs, which allows for complex queries into a user's data without compromising privacy. The platform aims to provide a foundation for applications that require cryptographic proofs for their core functionalities, ensuring data integrity and user privacy. Additionally, the PCD SDK within the Zupass ecosystem offers a framework for developing applications that utilize PCDs for their core features, including interfaces for producing and consuming PCDs, and a 'passport' web application for managing personal PCDs and interacting with third-party applications.",
