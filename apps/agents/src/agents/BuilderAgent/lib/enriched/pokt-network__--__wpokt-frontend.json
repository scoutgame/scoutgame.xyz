  "summary": "The wPOKT Bridge is a frontend application that enables the transfer of POKT tokens between the Pocket Network and the Ethereum mainnet. It allows users to wrap POKT tokens into wPOKT (wrapped POKT) for use on the Ethereum network and to unwrap wPOKT back into POKT for use on the Pocket Network. The application supports transactions from both Ledger hardware wallets and standard Ethereum wallets, offering a secure and user-friendly interface for token transfers. Key features include the ability to connect to both Pocket and Ethereum wallets, estimate gas costs, and track the status of bridge transactions. Built using Next.js, the application integrates with WalletConnect for wallet interactions, utilizes Chakra UI for the user interface, and employs MongoDB for data storage. It leverages the Pocket Network's RPC gateway for blockchain interactions and supports operations in both mainnet and testnet environments. The wPOKT Bridge is designed to provide a seamless and efficient experience for users looking to transfer tokens across these two blockchains.",
