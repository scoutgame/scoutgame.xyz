  "summary": "Garaga is an advanced tool designed for elliptic curve operations and SNARKs verification, specifically optimized for the StarkNet platform using Cairo for efficient computation. It supports a variety of elliptic curves such as BN254, BLS12_381, SECP256/R1, and ED25519, facilitating operations like scalar and multi-scalar multiplication, pairing operations, and the generation of Groth16 smart contract verifiers. By leveraging Starkware's builtin for emulated modular arithmetic and employing non-deterministic techniques for extension field multiplication, pairings, and multi scalar multiplication, Garaga achieves high performance. This tool is particularly beneficial for developers focused on creating privacy-preserving applications, implementing zero-knowledge proofs, and enhancing blockchain scalability on the StarkNet platform.",
