  "summary": "Kakarot RPC serves as a pivotal element within the Kakarot zkEVM rollup, aimed at facilitating interoperability between the Ethereum and Starknet ecosystems. By implementing the Ethereum JSON-RPC specification, it enables Ethereum-compatible interactions with the Kakarot zkEVM, which operates on Starknet's CairoVM. This compatibility allows developers to utilize popular Ethereum tools such as Metamask, Hardhat, and Foundry for seamless interaction with Kakarot zkEVM. The project is structured around a three-part architecture comprising Kakarot EVM Cairo Programs, Kakarot RPC, and Kakarot Indexer, collectively striving to offer a fully Ethereum-compatible environment on Starknet. Kakarot RPC functions as an adapter layer, translating EVM-compatible payloads and calls to interact with the StarknetOS client, thereby enabling the execution of Ethereum smart contracts on Starknet. Currently, the development of Kakarot RPC is paused, with the repository frozen to prevent new issues and pull requests. It is distributed under the MIT license but remains unaudited.",
