  "summary": "Frog is a framework specifically designed for the development of Farcaster Frames, which are interactive elements within the Farcaster ecosystem. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools and utilities aimed at simplifying the creation, management, and deployment of these frames. Frog is built on Hono, a fast web framework, and supports a range of functionalities including user interaction handling, state management, and integration with Farcaster's API for actions such as casting and composing messages. Additionally, it provides features like live preview, hot reload, and time-travel debugging through its built-in devtools. Frog also leverages JSX for creating high-quality, performant frames that can be integrated across various platforms like Next.js, Vercel, and Cloudflare. With support for frame routing, middleware, and integration with Farcaster's Hub API for message verification, along with a CLI for scaffolding projects and a development server for local testing, Frog aims to enhance the developer experience by streamlining the creation of engaging and interactive Farcaster Frames.",
