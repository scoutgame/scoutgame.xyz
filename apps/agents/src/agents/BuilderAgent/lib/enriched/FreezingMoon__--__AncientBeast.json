  "summary": "Ancient Beast is an indie turn-based strategy game set in a dystopian future, where players engage in online multiplayer battles using a variety of creatures. These creatures are divided into seven factions, each inspired by the seven deadly sins, adding a unique thematic layer to the gameplay. The game is designed to be accessible yet challenging, with a focus on strategic depth. It is optimized for a wide range of devices, supporting multiple input methods including mouse, keyboard, and touchscreens, with future plans to incorporate gamepads, voice commands, AR/VR glasses, and brainwave headbands. Currently in pre-alpha, the game is still developing key features such as online multiplayer, bots, and unit animations. The development is transitioning to the Freezing Moon DAO, with a roadmap that includes the addition of new creatures, soundtracks, and combat locations, aiming to enrich the gaming experience and strategic possibilities.",
