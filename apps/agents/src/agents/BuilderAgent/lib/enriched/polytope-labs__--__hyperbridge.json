  "summary": "Hyperbridge is a decentralized, hyper-scalable coprocessor designed to facilitate verifiable cross-chain interoperability. It allows for seamless communication and interaction between different blockchain networks without the need for staking or whitelisting, ensuring a fully permissionless environment. This platform is particularly advantageous for developers aiming to build secure, mission-critical cross-chain applications that operate without relying on centralized or trusted security models. Supporting a wide range of blockchain networks, including those based on EVM and Polkadot-sdk, Hyperbridge is already in use by several projects for its verifiable interoperability features. Its core functionality is centered around providing a secure, scalable, and decentralized infrastructure for cross-chain communication and transactions, utilizing interoperability proofs to guarantee the integrity and verifiability of cross-chain messages. This makes Hyperbridge an indispensable tool for developers looking to create decentralized applications that span multiple blockchain ecosystems.",
