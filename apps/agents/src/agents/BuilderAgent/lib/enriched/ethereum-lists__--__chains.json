  "summary": "This GitHub repository is a centralized resource for EVM-based chains, offering a detailed collection of JSON files that encapsulate essential chain information such as configurations, RPC endpoints, native currencies, and additional metadata. It strictly follows the Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposal (CAIP) standards, particularly CAIP-2, to ensure a consistent format for chain identification and metadata representation. The repository not only aggregates this data into consolidated JSON files for easy access and integration by developers and applications but also includes mechanisms for managing chain data, preventing collisions to safeguard against replay attacks, and providing chain and explorer icons that are publicly accessible via IPFS. Designed to support a broad spectrum of blockchain applications, including wallets and explorers, this repository is a vital tool for developers seeking a standardized and comprehensive source of chain information.",
