  "summary": "The GitHub repository presents a detailed rewards distribution system designed for the HAI ecosystem, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. It focuses on incentivizing user participation through various campaigns that reward activities such as borrowing cryptocurrencies (WETH, WSTETH, OP) and providing liquidity in the HAI/ETH Uniswap V3 pool. Participants can earn KITE and OP tokens as rewards, with campaigns structured around specific time frames and detailed allocations for daily and total rewards. The repository includes scripts and directories for aggregating and processing raw data to ensure accurate and fair distribution of rewards. This system aims to enhance liquidity and stability within the HAI ecosystem by rewarding users for their contributions, thereby fostering a vibrant and engaged community. The initiative underscores a commitment to transparency and efficiency in the reward distribution process, leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized and incentivized financial environment.",
