  "summary": "The MACI Platform is a comprehensive solution designed for conducting secure and private voting and funding rounds using the Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (MACI). It consists of two main components: the Coordinator Service, which automates MACI operations, and the Interface, a web application for managing and participating in MACI polls. This platform is particularly focused on enhancing privacy to reduce bribery and collusion, making it suitable for applications like Retroactive Public Goods Funding, as utilized by the Optimism Collective. It leverages Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) as its backbone to facilitate this funding, rewarding contributors while incorporating a privacy layer. Supporting various networks, including Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon, among others, the MACI Platform is designed to be a versatile tool for communities and projects seeking decentralized and private voting mechanisms. It provides a robust framework for decentralized decision-making and resource allocation, catering to a wide range of voting and funding needs.",
