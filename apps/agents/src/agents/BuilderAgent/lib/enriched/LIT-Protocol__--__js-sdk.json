  "summary": "The Lit Protocol JavaScript/TypeScript SDK V7.x.x is a comprehensive toolkit designed for developers to integrate decentralized functionality into their applications. It provides a framework for implementing features such as cryptographic key management, blockchain wallet interactions, decentralized authentication and authorization, distributed computing and signing, smart contract management, and access control and encryption services. Supporting both Node.js and browser environments, the SDK offers packages for various functionalities including access control conditions, authentication helpers, and cryptographic operations. This enables developers to create secure, decentralized applications with ease, leveraging Lit's network for encryption, decryption, and access control based on blockchain conditions. The SDK is particularly useful for building applications that require secure data sharing, user authentication, content access control, and decentralized identity verification in a decentralized manner.",
