  "summary": "Unlock is a membership protocol designed to empower creators by enabling them to monetize their content or software directly, bypassing intermediaries. It offers a unified platform for consumers to efficiently manage their subscriptions and incentivizes the sharing of valuable content and applications. Built on smart contracts, Unlock includes a web application that facilitates the creation and management of memberships, aiming to decentralize the web by allowing creators to directly connect with their audience. This approach provides a transparent and fair method for monetizing digital content. The project is open-source, encouraging community contributions and fostering an environment of collaboration and innovation.",
