  "summary": "permissionless.js is a TypeScript library aimed at simplifying the deployment and management of ERC-4337 smart accounts on the Ethereum blockchain. It offers a high-level API for interacting with smart accounts, including well-known implementations such as Safe, Kernel, and Biconomy. The library facilitates the use of bundler actions in line with ERC-4337 standards, enabling gas fee sponsorship through paymaster actions and providing utility functions for managing User Operations. Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, it allows for the integration of custom smart account systems, bundlers, paymasters, and signers. This makes permissionless.js an essential tool for developers seeking to enhance decentralized applications with advanced smart account functionalities, including gasless transactions and batch operations, thereby improving the overall user experience.",
