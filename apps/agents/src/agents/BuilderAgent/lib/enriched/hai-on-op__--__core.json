  "summary": "The HAI repository is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, forked from the GEB (GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach) system, designed to manage collateralized debt positions (CDPs) and issue a stablecoin pegged to a target value, such as USD. It enables users to lock collateral to generate the stablecoin, HAI, with mechanisms in place to collect stability fees and liquidate undercollateralized positions through auctions to maintain the peg. The system supports multiple collateral types, each with customizable parameters for safety, liquidation, and stability fees. Governance mechanisms are integrated to allow for the adjustment of system parameters and the distribution of surplus funds. The platform is built on highly modular smart contracts, ensuring flexibility and adaptability. The code is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, promoting open-source development and distribution.",
