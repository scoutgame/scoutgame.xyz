  "summary": "The Game7 Protocol repository serves as a foundational mono-repository for the Game7 ecosystem, encompassing frontend, backend, and web3 components. Central to its offerings are the Game7 ERC20 token and a permissionless staking contract (Staker) that accommodates a variety of token types, including native tokens, ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens. Additionally, the Metronome contract plays a crucial role in incentivizing regular transactions, enhancing fairness in blockhash-based on-chain entropy sources, and promoting steady block production on the Game7 testnet. The repository is equipped with development and testing tools, notably the `game7` command-line tool for deploying and interacting with contracts, and `graffiti` for documenting execution flows. Designed to bolster the Game7 ecosystem, the protocol facilitates token staking, encourages network participation, and supports the deployment and interaction with smart contracts on both the Ethereum mainnet and Game7 testnet, leveraging Ethereum's Layer 2 solutions for improved scalability and efficiency.",
