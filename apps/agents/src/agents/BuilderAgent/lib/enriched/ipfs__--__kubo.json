  "summary": "Kubo stands as the pioneering and most extensively utilized implementation of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), a protocol designed for decentralized storage and content addressing. Developed in Go, Kubo empowers users to operate an IPFS node, enabling the storage and retrieval of content across a distributed network. This system supports a variety of features, including the operation of an IPFS node as a network service, an HTTP Gateway for content retrieval, HTTP Routing V1 for delegated routing lookups, a Command Line Interface (CLI) for node management, and a WebUI for simplified node management. Kubo's architecture facilitates participation in both local and wide area distributed hash tables (DHTs), enhancing its capability for peer-to-peer content sharing. Additionally, it offers content blocking for public node operators and maintains interoperability with HTTP, serving as a crucial component for the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and services. By leveraging IPLD's data models for content addressing and libp2p for network communication, Kubo aims to establish a more durable, versioned, and peer-to-peer filesystem, integrating the most effective concepts from Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia, SFS, and the Web.",
