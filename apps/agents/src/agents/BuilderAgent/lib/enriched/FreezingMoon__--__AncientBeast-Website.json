  "summary": "Ancient Beast is an engaging open-source, turn-based strategy indie game that merges the strategic depth of chess with the collectible aspect of card games. It offers a rich multiplayer online experience where players can collect a variety of creatures, each with unique abilities, and equip them with items to outmaneuver and defeat opponents. Designed to be accessible yet challenging, the game is easy to pick up but offers a complex strategic layer that rewards mastery. Developed with web technologies such as HTML, PHP, and JavaScript, Ancient Beast is playable directly in modern browsers without the need for additional plugins, ensuring wide accessibility. The game is free to play and thrives on community involvement, with Freezing Moon and its community driving its development. Ancient Beast not only promotes the use of open-source tools for game development and asset creation but also encourages contributions from the community in various forms, including coding, artwork, and audio, fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment for both players and contributors.",
