  "summary": "This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive project designed to interact with and analyze smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, featuring a user-friendly interface for deploying contracts, debugging, and interacting with them through a web application. The project, named 'Impact Calculator', includes a Next.js frontend for the web interface and a Hardhat backend for smart contract development and deployment. It offers key functionalities such as contract deployment, interaction with deployed contracts, debugging tools, and a block explorer for transaction and contract analysis. A standout feature is the 'Impact Calculator' tool, which analyzes and visualizes the impact of certain vectors or parameters within the blockchain ecosystem, likely related to user activity or contract interactions. Aimed at developers and users interested in Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, the project provides essential tools for development, debugging, and analysis, supporting both Ethereum and local development networks.",
