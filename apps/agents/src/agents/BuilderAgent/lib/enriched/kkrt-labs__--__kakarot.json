  "summary": "Kakarot is a zkEVM (zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine) implementation designed to bridge the gap between Ethereum and Starknet ecosystems. Written in Cairo, a high-level zero-knowledge domain-specific language, Kakarot enables developers to execute Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) transactions in a provable manner, leveraging the CairoVM for zero-knowledge proofs. This innovative approach allows Ethereum developers to build and deploy smart contracts as if they were working directly on Ethereum, while also being forward-compatible with the advancements in zero-knowledge technology. Kakarot supports 100% of EVM opcodes and most precompiles, making it a robust tool for developers aiming to integrate zero-knowledge proofs into their Ethereum-based applications without leaving the Ethereum ecosystem. It can be deployed as a smart contract on any chain that runs the CairoVM, including StarknetOS chains, Starknet Appchains, and Starknet clients, thereby providing an EVM runtime embedded within a Starknet appchain. This project signifies a pivotal step towards enhancing blockchain interoperability and scalability, enabling Ethereum developers to harness the capabilities of the Starknet ecosystem seamlessly.",
