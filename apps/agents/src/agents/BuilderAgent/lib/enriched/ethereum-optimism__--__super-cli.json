  "summary": "The `sup` CLI tool is designed to simplify the deployment and management of smart contracts across multiple blockchain networks, with a focus on the Superchain ecosystem, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. It enhances the development experience by offering features such as interactive deployment modes, the ability to deploy and verify contracts simultaneously across multiple chains, and bridging funds to various chains for gas fees. Unlike traditional tools, `sup` supports the use of connected wallets like Metamask and WalletConnect, removing the need for `.env` files with private keys. This tool is particularly beneficial for developers engaged in multichain projects, aiming to reduce the complexity and improve the efficiency of deploying and managing smart contracts across different blockchain environments. It is a complementary tool to existing development frameworks like `foundry`, focusing on making multi-chain development more accessible and streamlined.",
