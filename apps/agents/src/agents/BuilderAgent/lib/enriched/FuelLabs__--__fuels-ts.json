  "summary": "The fuels-ts repository is a TypeScript SDK tailored for the Fuel blockchain, aimed at facilitating the development of decentralized applications (dApps) and enabling interaction with the Fuel network. It equips developers with essential tools for connecting to the Fuel network, creating and deploying smart contracts, and generating TypeScript types from Sway's ABI JSON files. The SDK features a CLI that streamlines project initialization, building, deploying contracts, and launching a local Fuel node with hot-reload functionality. It is versatile, supporting both mainnet and testnet environments, thereby offering a robust platform for developers to build, test, and deploy their dApps on the Fuel blockchain. The repository is committed to fostering a vibrant community, encouraging contributions through bug reports, feature additions, and requests, all within an open, welcoming, and inclusive atmosphere as outlined in its Code of Conduct. Comprehensive documentation and examples are provided to assist developers in kickstarting their Fuel dApp development journey.",
