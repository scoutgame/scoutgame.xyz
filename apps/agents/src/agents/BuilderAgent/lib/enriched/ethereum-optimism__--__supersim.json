  "summary": "Supersim is a lightweight tool designed to simulate the Superchain ecosystem locally, including a single Layer 1 (L1) and multiple OP-Stack Layer 2 (L2) chains. It enables developers to spin up multiple anvil nodes, predeploy OP Stack contracts, and useful mock contracts like ERC20 tokens. Supersim supports forking multiple remote chains to simulate the entire Superchain, facilitating L1 <> L2 message passing (deposits) and L2 <> L2 message passing (interoperability). This tool is particularly useful for testing multichain features, simulating cross-chain application flows, and iterating on cross-chain features locally with a simple developer interface. Supersim can be run in vanilla mode for basic setups or in fork mode to interact with the state of existing testnet/mainnet chains without redeploying contracts. It also offers Docker support for a consistent development environment and includes features like automatic message relaying for L2 to L2 transfers, enhancing the developer experience by simplifying the testing of complex interactions within the Superchain ecosystem.",
