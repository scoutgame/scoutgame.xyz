  "summary": "The GitHub repository presents a comprehensive suite of strategies for calculating voting power and delegations within decentralized governance systems. It supports a variety of token standards, including ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155, and is designed to integrate with various DeFi protocols and platforms. These strategies enable the determination of user influence based on factors such as token holdings and staking positions. The repository is highly modular, facilitating the easy addition of new strategies and validations. It includes tools for testing and validating these strategies to ensure they meet specific criteria for uniqueness, efficiency, and scalability. The strategies are intended for use in governance platforms like Snapshot, supporting decentralized decision-making processes in a transparent and efficient manner. The repository also provides a development environment setup, testing procedures, and a checklist for adding new strategies, making it a valuable resource for developers working on decentralized governance systems.",
