  "summary": "The GitHub repository features an SDK tailored for interacting with the GEB (Global Ethereum Backed) smart contracts, enabling users to manage safes, mint RAI (a stablecoin), and inspect the system's state. Developed in TypeScript, the SDK provides full typing support and a low-level API for direct contract interactions. It facilitates a range of operations including opening and managing safes, minting and repaying debt, and participating in auctions for surplus or debt. Additionally, it supports actions such as locking ETH as collateral, drawing RAI, and inspecting safe details like debt and liquidation prices. The SDK is designed to work across both mainnet and testnet environments, offering a robust toolset for engaging with the GEB system's financial mechanisms, including collateral management, debt issuance, and liquidation processes. This makes it an essential resource for users interested in DeFi applications, collateral management, and stablecoin operations within the GEB ecosystem.",
