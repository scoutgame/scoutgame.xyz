  "summary": "Yttrium is a versatile cross-platform library aimed at simplifying the development of applications that leverage smart accounts, primarily within the Ethereum ecosystem. It offers essential abstractions and primitives for wallets and decentralized applications (DApps) to facilitate interaction with and implementation of smart account functionalities. A significant objective of Yttrium is to enhance externally owned account (EOA) wallets by enabling advanced features like batch transactions and transaction sponsorship for users. While its initial focus is on Ethereum, Yttrium aspires to evolve into a cross-chain account abstraction library, broadening its support to various blockchain platforms in the future. The library is built around a core Rust library, which can be compiled into native libraries for multiple platforms, including Swift for Apple platforms and WebAssembly for web applications. This design ensures Yttrium's adaptability and accessibility for developers across different ecosystems. Currently in a pre-alpha stage, Yttrium is under active development, with plans to incorporate standards such as ERC-4337 and ERC-7702. It supports a range of programming languages and platforms, including Swift, Rust, and has planned support for JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin, Flutter, and C#/Unity, targeting platforms like Apple, Linux, and future support for WebAssembly, Android, Web, and Windows.",
