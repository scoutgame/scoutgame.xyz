It supports functionalities such as user authentication, wallet management, and the distribution of GoodDollar tokens, aiming to create a more inclusive and equitable financial system. The project is open-source, encouraging community involvement through contributions, discussions, and collaboration to drive innovation and ensure the security of the digital economy.
