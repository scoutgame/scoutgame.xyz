  "summary": "The GoodCollective protocol and dapp is a decentralized application aimed at facilitating the creation and management of pools for rewarding climate stewards and establishing Basic Income pools with dynamic members. It utilizes blockchain technology to ensure transparent and efficient distribution of rewards based on climate actions, which are represented as NFTs. The protocol supports the creation of Direct Payments Pools and Basic Income pools, where rewards are distributed according to predefined rules and the data associated with minted NFTs. This innovative approach allows for the unique representation and rewarding of each climate action, fostering a community of engaged and incentivized participants. The platform is designed to be accessible both as a web application and a native mobile app, ensuring wide accessibility. By integrating with Superfluid for G$ streams, it enables users to support pools continuously. The project's goal is to empower communities by providing direct digital payments to those contributing to climate action and basic income initiatives, thereby maximizing impact and promoting sustainable development.",
