  "summary": "This GitHub repository contains a codebase aimed at calculating and distributing rewards to users engaged in a decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, particularly those interacting with Ethereum-based smart contracts. It utilizes blockchain data to monitor user activities, such as adjustments to collateralized debt positions (CDPs) and participation in liquidity pools. The system processes these interactions to calculate rewards, taking into account user contributions and staking weights. It employs subgraphs for efficient data querying and Google BigQuery for managing large datasets, culminating in the generation of a CSV file that outlines the rewards allocated to each user. This tool is pivotal for DeFi projects seeking to incentivize user participation and ensure a transparent and equitable reward distribution process.",
