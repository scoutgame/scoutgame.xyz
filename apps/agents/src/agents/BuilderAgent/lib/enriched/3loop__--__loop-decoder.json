  "summary": "This GitHub repository hosts a versatile toolkit aimed at decoding and interpreting blockchain transactions, with a focus on Ethereum and compatible networks. It provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing smart contract interactions by decoding transaction data, including method calls and event logs. The toolkit is designed to support a wide range of blockchain networks and smart contract standards, offering functionality for fetching and managing Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs) from various sources. This enables accurate decoding of contract interactions and facilitates the interpretation of transactions into human-readable formats. Users can categorize transactions based on their nature, such as swaps, transfers, and approvals, and identify the involved contracts, including ERC20 and ERC721. Aimed at developers, analysts, and enthusiasts, this tool simplifies the complexity of raw blockchain data, making transaction analysis more accessible and supporting the development of transparent and user-friendly decentralized applications (dApps).",
