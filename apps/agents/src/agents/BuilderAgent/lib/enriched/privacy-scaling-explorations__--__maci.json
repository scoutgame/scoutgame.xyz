  "summary": "The Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (MACI) is an advanced on-chain voting protocol aimed at bolstering privacy and reducing the risks of collusion and bribery in voting systems. Utilizing zk-SNARKs, MACI ensures that votes are encrypted and tallied securely, preventing voters from proving their choices to potential bribers and thus diminishing the impact of bribery. The protocol incorporates a trusted coordinator to process and tally votes, maintaining the integrity of the voting process without exposing individual votes. Key features of MACI include user sign-up, message publishing, message processing, and vote tallying, all secured through cryptographic techniques and smart contracts. It supports various voting strategies, such as quadratic voting, and introduces mechanisms like top-up credits and pairwise subsidies to further strengthen its anti-collusion properties. Designed for applications that demand secure, private, and collusion-resistant voting mechanisms, MACI is particularly beneficial for public goods funding and DAO governance, offering a robust foundation for fair and transparent decision-making in decentralized environments.",
