  "summary": "Spellbook is an open-source, community-driven project that transforms raw blockchain data into understandable and actionable insights. Utilizing the dbt (data build tool) framework, it enables users to contribute SQL queries, referred to as 'spells', which create models for processing and analyzing blockchain data. These models simplify complex blockchain records into interpretable data, facilitating a better understanding of blockchain activities. The project is organized into sub-projects, each focusing on different sectors such as DEX (Decentralized Exchanges), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and tokens, with dedicated sets of spells for each. Spellbook actively encourages community participation through pull requests, issues, and discussions, aiming to address gaps in blockchain data interpretation and analysis. Comprehensive documentation is provided, covering contributions, setting up development environments, and using dbt to craft spells, ensuring the project is accessible to contributors of all experience levels.",
