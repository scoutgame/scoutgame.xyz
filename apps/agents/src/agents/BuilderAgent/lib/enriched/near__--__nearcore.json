  "summary": "The NEAR Protocol repository serves as a comprehensive platform for developing decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, emphasizing usability and scalability. It offers a developer-friendly environment with tools and libraries that enable the creation of applications where users have control over their data and assets. Supporting server-less applications and smart contracts, NEAR Protocol provides scalability and usability akin to modern PaaS solutions, but more cost-effectively compared to other blockchain platforms. The platform includes a variety of developer resources, such as client libraries, SDKs for Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript, and extensive documentation and examples to aid in dApp development. Aligned with the 'Open Web' movement, NEAR Protocol aims to foster a more open and accessible internet. The repository also facilitates community engagement, allowing users to join the network as validators, contribute to the protocol's development, and participate in community discussions. Additionally, it features a changelog that documents ongoing protocol and non-protocol changes, showcasing the platform's continuous evolution and enhancements.",
