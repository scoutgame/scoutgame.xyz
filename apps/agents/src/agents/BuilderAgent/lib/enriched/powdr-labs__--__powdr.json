  "summary": "powdr is a comprehensive toolkit designed for building zkVMs (zero-knowledge Virtual Machines) and similar proof frameworks. It features two main components: powdr-asm, an extensible assembly IR language for dynamic executions, and powdr-PIL, a low-level constraint language for defining arithmetic constraints, lookups, and more. The toolkit supports the compilation of Rust code to RISCV, then to powdr-asm, and finally to powdr-PIL, enabling the generation of proofs using multiple backends such as Plonky3, Halo2, and eSTARK. powdr automates all stages of the compilation pipeline, ensuring that the system is not underconstrained and that all artifacts are human-readable. It is highly flexible, allowing for the adaptation of powdr assembly to any VM, and focuses on VM support and developer experience, with plans to optimize performance further. The project is licensed under Apache-2.0 or MIT, encouraging contributions under these terms.",
