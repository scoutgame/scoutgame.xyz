        Developers gain recognition and earn Gems by contributing to approved open-source projects. Each season lasts
        three months, and Developers receive weekly rewards based on their contributions. At the end of each week, Gems
        are converted into Scout Points, with higher-ranked Developers earning more points per gem.
