        Scouts participate by collecting NFTs associated with top developers during each season. As these developers
        excel—by contributing to codebases—Scouts accumulate points. The more successful your chosen developers, the
        more points you earn.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        By accumulating Scout Points, you can exchange them to scout even more developers, boosting your standing within
        the game and increasing your potential rewards.
