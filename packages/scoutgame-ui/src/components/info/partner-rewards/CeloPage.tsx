        Ecosystem projects, that you can find in the list below (link list below), will mark their issues with a Tier in
        GitHub. The Tier determines the developer's reward offered by Celo for merging a PR that addresses the issue.
        Unmarked issues will default to the Common Tier.

        How to contribute

      <Typography>
        Open Source contributions can be overwhelming when you are staring out. It is important to check a repository
        for a contribution guide. If they don't offer one, you can refer back to a general one or use the{' '}
        <Link href='https://docs.celo.org/general/ecosystem/contributors' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>
          Open Source Contribution guide
        </Link>{' '}
        provided by Celo

      <Alert severity='info'>
        This is the chance for you to <strong>learn</strong> and <strong>grow</strong> and make connections. Make sure
        to <strong>reply</strong> to repo-maintainers, implement their feedback and communicate!!! If anything is
        unclear, ask! It is normal that a new repository can be overwhelming. So, communicate, communicate, communicate
        and learn!
      </Alert>
      <Typography>
        Here are some general <strong>steps to get started</strong> if you are new to open source contributions:
      </Typography>
      <List listStyleType='decimal'>
        <ListItem>
          Understand the repositories architecture and functions (e.g., if a repo is about EIP make sure you understand
          the structure of EIPs). <strong>Read some code</strong> (best way to learn)
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>Check the reported issue and make sure you understand what is asked of you</ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          Create a <strong>fork</strong> of the repository and clone your fork to your local machine. You need to fork
          the repository, as you won't have direct write access to the main repository
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <strong>Run the code</strong> and reproduce the same behaviour
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <strong>Clarify</strong> all <strong>open questions</strong> from the issue. Make sure you dive deep into the
          repo before asking questions but also donâ€™t waste time getting lost. Most of the time, when formulating a
          question, everything will become clear.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>If the coding language is unfamiliar to you, do a simple introduction course</ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          Optional: try test first approach, where you write the test first to make sure to check for the error that
          occurs
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>Implement your solution</ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          Write <strong>tests</strong> if you haven't done it yet
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          Write <strong>documentation</strong> (based on how documentation is done in that repository)
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          Create a PR mentioning the Issue and explaining the solution, this will help the repo maintainer understand
          what you did and merge your PR quickly
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          Implement any <strong>feedback</strong> the maintainer asks for
